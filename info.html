        <header>Why Is Sleeping Important?</header>
        <p>Sleep is important for all ages. For children and teenagers, sleep plays a major role in physical and mental development. For adults, sleep helps improve brain performance, memory, mood, mental, and physical health. When you sleep, your body rests and repairs itself, while your brain prepares to learn, remember, and create.</p>
        <p>For college students, who are always studying, working, and learning, sleep is essential to maximize academic performance. It is also important to note that having good sleep must be done regularly. Lawrence Epstein, a medical director of Sleep HealthCenters, states that a student who's slept for less than 6 hours for two weeks performed as badly as one who didn't sleep for 48 hours.</p>
        <p class="important">For adults, the recommended amount of sleep is 7 - 9 hours a day.</p>
